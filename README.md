# StrideMate 🏃‍♂️💡  

## Overview  
**StrideMate** is my first project integrating **DevOps** and **Machine Learning** to deliver a personalized training experience.  
The core functionality revolves around generating a **custom training plan** based on the user's current fitness level.  

## How It Works 🚀  
1. **Initial Workout** – The user completes a short test run.  
2. **Data Collection** – Images from the treadmill interface are captured.  
3. **Fitness Assessment** – The system analyzes the gathered data.  
4. **Training Plan Generation** – A personalized plan is created based on the results.  

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
- **DevOps:** _Jenkins?_  
- **Machine Learning:** _SageMaker?_  
- **Infrastructure:** _AWS?_  

## Future Plans 🌟  
- 🔹 Enhance the ML model for better fitness predictions.  
- 🔹 Integrate with wearable devices for real-time tracking.  
- 🔹 Deploy as a scalable cloud service.
